    "In [the previous notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/blob/main/notebooks/6.2-multi-fidelity.ipynb), I provided a brief introduction of multi-fidelity\n",

    "the lowest fidelities, the highest fidelities (default), and approximately halfway in-between. For validation, the\n",
    "objective (in this case, `frechet`) will be evaluated at the upper bound of `atime` and `astep`. In\n",
    "this experiment, we'll allow `atime` to vary between `0..100` (upper limit is 255) which is:\n",

    "with Ax](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/issues/1211) (i.e. requires using BoTorch directly), we'll fix `astep` to `999` (limits are `0..65534`). In terms\n",

    "> The Knowledge Gradient (KG) (see [2, 3]) is a look-ahead acquisition function that quantifies the expected increase in the maximum of the modeled black-box function f from obtaining additional (random) observations collected at the candidate set x. KG often shows improved Bayesian Optimization performance relative to simpler acquisition functions such as Expected Improvement, but in its traditional form it is computationally expensive and hard to implement.\n",
